# Searching for Posts/Pods
To find what you are looking for simply open up the file you wish to view. You can either download the text file first and then open in your favorite text editor, or depending on your browser, you may also be able to open it directly.

Once the appropriate file is open, use the applications built in search facility, such as in Notepad. When you've found what you're looking for, copy the text into the clipboard.

e.g. the-official-follow-follow-liz-hurley-appreciation-thread.2028 (The Lounge/Bearpit format)
e.g. Stuff and Nonsense! Episode 1 (Heart and Hand format)

## Using the Result with Follow Follow
Next, you need to add this to the string below (I know this is a pain, but there's a reason for it), copy it to the clipboard and then paste in your browser.

So the above becomes :

# Searching Heard and Hand Podcasts
Working on this. Have been in contact with Patreon because their search facility is really pretty poor and makes finding posts really difficult.
